# Introduction to Programming Fundamentals (PF)

Programming Fundamentals (PF) is a crucial subject that lays the groundwork for understanding computer programming. Hereâ€™s a basic overview of the core topics:

- **Programming Basics:** This includes understanding fundamental concepts such as variables (which store data), data types (like integers and strings), and operators.
- **Control Structures:** Learn about conditionals (e.g., if-else statements) that allow the execution of code blocks based on certain conditions, and loops.
- **Functions:** Functions are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They help in modularizing code, making it reusable, and simplifying debugging.
- **Data Structures:** Introduction to various ways of organizing data, such as arrays (collections of items), lists (ordered collections of items), and dictionaries (collections of key-value pairs).
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Basics of problem-solving approaches, including understanding how to design and implement algorithms to solve problems efficiently.
